# FEND Arcade Game
Simple frogger game project

Main objective collect all pickups and finish a game but be careful don't get hit by a bug.
Player got 3 lives to spend and there is a chance to get health pickup.
Stepping on water block without star will respawn you (secret there is a small timer so you can move without stopping).
By finishing a level you can unlock a character (maximum of 4 new) and select it after losing all lives.
